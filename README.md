Bootstrap Web Developer Portfolio for Programming Boot Camp

This is part 1 of Homework 2 from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. I have created a personal portfolio from scratch, using Bootstrap components. The site has three pages:

-an "about me" page
-a "portfolio" page
-a "contact" page

In each page, all elements are wrapped in some sort of Bootstrap component, making them responsive to screen resizing. The 'about me' and 'portfolio' pages make use of the grid system, where content is divided into rows, which are divided into columns spaced relative to the viewport width. The images are also responsive.
